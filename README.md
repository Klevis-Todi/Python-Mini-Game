# Python-Mini-Game
Title: Klevis’s Halloween Escape


By: Klevis Todi


Description: A small mini-game, where you try to get the hostage outside of the ghost and goblin rooms. You also have mini-tasks you need to complete before you can fully exit from the door.


Explanation: In the code, I created classes that I would use to create the objects in the game (Main character, ghost, squishy monster). These objects are subclasses of the parent class “Actor”, Which has a non-implanted method later implanted into these subclasses. To create the map, I created a text file with symbols on it and each symbol resembles an object (wall, door, etc.). In the text files for the map on each level “X” represents a brick wall. To create the map I initialized the game and looped through the file created an object at the location of each symbol and attached an image to the object. During the game, there is a continuous loop running in the background. The loop ends when the player has died, and then it results in a termination of the program.


Guide: Use your keyboard arrows to navigate your character outside or the room safely, before the monsters eat him. Before any doors open you must complete each task of the levels. Level 1 you must collect all the starts. Level 2 you must box up all the mini monsters before escaping. Lastly, in level 3 you must collect each key for each door before escaping the main door.

Reflection: Overall I enjoyed this project. It wasn’t your typical college project, it really provoked your creativity, made you think outside the box, and do further learning to better your understanding of Python. Even though I came across many obstacles these few weeks on this project, it greatly benefited me. These setbacks helped me analyze code better and taught me a lot of patience.
